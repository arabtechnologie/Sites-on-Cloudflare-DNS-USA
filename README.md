# Sites-on-Cloudflare-DNS-USA
This is an (archived) list of sites on Cloudflare DNS at the time of the CloudBleed HTTPS traffic leak announcement. Original vuln thread by Google Project Zero.  Cloudflare has posted a very detailed response, explaining exactly what the implications of this leak are. It thoroughly explains their language in earlier statements, and I highly recommend reading it before looking through this list for domains: https://blog.cloudflare.com/quantifying-the-impact-of-cloudbleed/
